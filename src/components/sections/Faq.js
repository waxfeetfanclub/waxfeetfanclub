                <Accordion title="WHAT IS WAX FEET FAN CLUB?">
                Step into the mesmerizing world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) within the WAX Ecosystem with our groundbreaking PFP project, immortalizing the beauty and uniqueness of FEET - and yes, we've got memes too! As the first project on the WAX Blockchain to implement the DEFLATIONARY NFTS mechanism, we'll buy back NFTs from the secondary market using our funds, including creator fees, and humorously burn them as needed.
                    </Accordion>
                
                
                <Accordion title="WHERE CAN WE BUY THE NFTS?">
                Initially, the NFTs will be available for the public through the PFP Drop provided by NFTHive. After the Drop ends, you can find it on secondary markets like Atomichub, Neftyblocks, NFTHive, ETC. For further queries, join our Discord community.

                <Accordion title="HOW WILL YOU MANAGE THE FUND?">
                The generated fund will be divided into two parts: 40% allocated to the Developer, Artist, and Team, while 60% will be used for the project. We plan to generate more funds through research and exploration of various methods, such as staking 60% to earn WAX daily. Suggestions for optimizing fund utilization are welcomed.
